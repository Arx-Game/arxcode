"""
Exploration Events

This module creates various random events that will occur for players when
they have their armies scout out unexplored territory in order to expand
their borders. They can encounter hostiles such as bandits, small clans
of Abandoned, fell sorcery, or horrible monsters. They can also have positive
events, such as discovering riches, natural resources, ancient artifacts/
magical items, and so on.
