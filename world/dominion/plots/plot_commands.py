    The plots command can be used to pitch storyline ideas. Open a ticket
    for GM approval of your plot with /pitch. If approved, you become its
    owner. Pitch requires a name, a one-sentence summary, a longer IC
    description, and OOC notes on what it aims to accomplish. Your pitch can
    reference another plot if you want to run a subplot of something larger.
    Plots can be tagged for easy search by topic. Clues, revelations, and
    theories may be added, with notes to show staff why they're connected.

    Advance a plot with beats: events or actions that progress it. Example,
    after a relevant event, GM uses /createbeat to summarize the plot update.
    Tie the event to this beat with /add/rpevent, then show it to staff with
    /rfr (request for review). Staff will change the world appropriately.

    Set plot permissions with /perm. Owners are administrators. GMs create
    beats; anyone may edit. Recruiters are contacts for newcomers. Casting
    options define how essential someone is: 'Required' cast must be present;
    plot is about them. 'Main' cast is involved in most events. 'Supporting'
    may be present sometimes, and 'Extra' indicates guest appearances.
    GMs should be Supporting cast at most.

    Plots are typically hidden until you are invited, but if your secret is
    a plot hook, the /findcontact switch lists recruiter characters who are
    points of contact for a plot. Their storyhook should give ideas of how
    characters might discover they are involved. Arrange a RP scene with one
    to pursue the plot. If they invite and you accept, /rewardrecruiter
    grants xp to you both. See your invitations with plots/invitations.
