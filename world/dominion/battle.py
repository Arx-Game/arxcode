"""
Battle system for dominion

So, what happens when two units fight? That's what this file is trying
to solve. We'll try for a more realistic approach in that units will
rarely fight until one side is completely annihilated - in general, units
will fight until they rout, and will often lose quite a few troops who
desert during the retreat, while others are killed in retreating.
