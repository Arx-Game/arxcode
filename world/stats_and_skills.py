"""
Template file for saving values of stats and skills.
Will add more class functionality later, with helper
functions and so on.

Stats are defined as an attribute from the name of the
stat, listed in the _valid_stats_ tuple. Skills and
abilities are held accessed in the traitshandler:
character.traits.skills and character.traits.abilities,
respectively. So while you can do
char.traits.strength, you would have to access
a skill by char.traits.get_skill_value('brawl'), for example.
