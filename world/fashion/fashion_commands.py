    Management: The /create switch makes a new outfit from your currently
    worn, sheathed, and wielded items. The /delete switch deletes an existing
    outfit, but its items still exist. Note that after deleting a modeled
    outfit, each of its items' "buzz messages" will revert to their
    individual value. Toggle the archive status of an outfit by specifying
    its name after the /archive switch.

    Viewing: With no switch or name, view your non-archived outfits.
    Similarly, use the archive switch without a name to see archived outfits.
    This table shows appraisal* of fashion-worth if it's yet to be modeled,
    or the buzz impact it had when it was. (See 'help model' for modeling.)
    Specify any outfit name with no switches to see the items comprising it.

    *An outfit's appraisal is based on items that can be modeled. Items
    that weren't crafted by mortals and pre-modeled items do not count
    toward the modeling value of an outfit. Appraisal allows a fashion
    model to compare the potential impact of outfits before events.

    A fashion model tests their composure & performance to earn fame. The
    organization sponsoring the model and the item's designer accrues a portion
    of fame as well. Although masks may be modeled, doing so will reveal the
    model's identity in subsequent item labels and informs.  Additionally,
    modeling must have an audience; you cannot model in an empty room.  The
    size and collective social rank of your audience will influence the amount
    of fame generated; showing off for a single commoner will not merit as
    much fame as modeling an outfit for the King!

    Without the /all switch for leaderboards, only Top 20 are displayed.

    If you want to ignore modeling emits (such as at parties and other large
    scenes), you can use the @settings command to turn on ignore_model_emit.
