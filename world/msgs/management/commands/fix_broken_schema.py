"""
During the python 2 to 3 conversion, I got this error a lot when I tried to do migrations:

django.db.utils.IntegrityError:
The row in table 'comms_msg_db_receivers_objects' with primary key '19035' has
an invalid foreign key: comms_msg_db_receivers_objects.msg_id contains a
value '198432' that does not have a corresponding value in comms_msg.id.

Basically, rows in join tables had invalid data - they should have been wiped
in CASCADE deletion when one of their FK references vanished, but didn't for
whatever reason. This command deletes them so migrations can run. Who knows
if the problem can recur, so I wanted a command in case it happens again.

Additionally, in the conversion of players_playerdb -> accounts_accountdb
tables, many foreignkeys were broken, but integrity errors weren't raised
until the newest version of django: specifying in django that they pointed
to the new table was enough to make them function properly. Now, however,
on any create/delete operation or attempting to run a migration, they'll
break. Since migrations can't fix it, this script has to do so.
