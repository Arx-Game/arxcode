    the strength, the more likely practitioners will see it.  If the /guaranteed switch

    The second form of this command will emit something mundane to everyone in the room,
    but will prepend the person's individual magicword so they know it isn't spoofed by
    someone else.  This is unlikely to be necessary often.

      magic/checkemit

    This command allows you to interact with the magic system for everything
    except actually performing magic; for that, you'll want the 'cast' command.

    With no parameters, magic will tell you a little about your current magical
    state.

    The first set of switches -- /nodes, /spells, and /effects -- will show you
    the nodes, spells, and effects you know, respectively. (For more information
    on these terms, please check the Guide to Magic.)

    The second set of switches will allow you to instruct someone else in a node
    (opening it for them if they don't already know it) so that their practice
    might go faster, or to teach them a spell or effect (which is instantaneous).

    The /practice switch will allow you to put time and energy towards practicing
    one or more nodes on your magic system skill tree.

    The last switches will let you adjust how you perform magic -- the verb for
    how you perform magic ('chants', 'sings', etc.), the language in which you
    do so, and a short description of how you move when you do.  The /checkemit
    switch will return what your current emit string is -- what the room will
    see every time you perform magic if you don't choose to pay the cost to
    perform it quietly. /animaritual allows you to set a custom message for an
    anima ritual that your character knows, which tend to be unique to each
    individual caster.

    NOTE: It is highly recommended you read the magic system tutorial before using
    this command!

    This command allows you to define and interact with magic workings. A working
    can have a spell (i.e., a specific known sequence of magic), a weave (which is
    working entirely without a net and making it up as you go, but more flexible),
    or an intent (which is a description of what you're trying, if the working will
    be handled by GMs).

    Workings can be actual workings (i.e. things you will perform, and can invite
    people to) or can be templates (i.e. things you will use later with the 'cast'
    spell and might do repeatedly).

    The first set of command switches will set up a form to define a working.  For
    a template, you must provide the name, and either a spell or weave effect,
    affinity, and alignment if you're trying something that isn't encapsulated in
    a spell.  The tool switch will set what of your magic focii you plan to use to
    aid you in this, and the familiar switch will set what familiar of yours you
    want to assist you in the working.  If you plan to perform the working not as
    a template, you may also need to provide a target.

    Once you've defined a working, you can /perform it -- you may need to use the
    /unsafe switch if it's calculated that the working would be riskier than
    usual.  You can also change out your familiar, tool, and add or remove
    objects to be drained of primum.  Right now, these must be trinkets from
    shardhavens, or weapons that have a significant amount of primum invested
    in them.  You can also add econ resources to be sacrificed.

    You can also invite other people to participate in a working; working together
    can decrease the relative danger of a working.

    To cast a pre-prepared template for a working.

    Usage:
      cast[/unsafe] <template>[=target]
      cast/view <template>
      cast/list

    This command will view your templated workings, and potentially cast one.
    The first form will actually cast a template (with an optional target
    for those workings that require one). If the working would be unsafe to
    perform in your present situation, it will prompt you and force you to
    use the /unsafe switch before it will actually perform the magic.

    The second form will view a template, along with the current calculated
    danger level.

    The third form will list all your templated workings.

    Working templates are defined using the 'working' command.
