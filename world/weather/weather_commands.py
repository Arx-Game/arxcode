class CmdAdminWeather(ArxCommand):
    """
    Provides administration for the weather system.

    Usage:
        @admin_weather
        @admin_weather/advance
        @admin_weather/announce
        @admin_weather/lock
        @admin_weather/unlock
        @admin_weather/set [custom weather emit]
        @admin_weather/settype <weather_id>=<intensity>
        @admin_weather/start

        The first form of this command will show you current weather information.
        The second will manually advance the weather, as though the weather pattern
        timer had just run.
        The third will pick an appropriate weather for the current weather patterns
        and announce it to everyone.  This is useful if you've just set a custom
        weather pattern, or reset back to normal.
        The fourth and fifth will lock or unlock the weather system, preventing
        changes from happening.
        The sixth will set a custom weather pattern, for unusual GM'd weather events.
        Remember to lock, or it'll go away when the weather changes again!
        The seventh will set the weather to a specific weather type and intensity,
        skipping all intermediate steps.  Mostly useful for testing, or GM'ing
        a specific weather type without setting a single GM emit.
        The eighth is used to restart the Weather system if, for some reason,
        it hasn't been running.
