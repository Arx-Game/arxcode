This defines the cmdset for the red_button. Here we have defined
the commands and the cmdset in the same module, but if you
have many different commands to merge it is often better
to define the cmdset separately, picking and choosing from
among the available commands as to what should be included in the
cmdset - this way you can often re-use the commands too.
