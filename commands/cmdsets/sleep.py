"""
This cmdset is to try to define the state of being dead.
It will replace the mobile command set, and then specific
other commands.

This is for a character who is dead. Not undead, such as
a sexy vampire or a shambling zombie. Not braindead, such
as someone who approaches RP as a competition. No, this is
for dead-dead. Stone dead. Super dead. The deadest.

Not that they will necessarily STAY that way. But while
this is on them, they are dead.
