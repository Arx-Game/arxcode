"""
This commandset attempts to define the combat state.
Combat in Arx isn't designed to mimic the real-time
nature of MMOs, or even a lot of MUDs. Our model is
closer to tabletop RPGs - a turn based system that
can only proceed when everyone is ready. The reason
for this is that having 'forced' events based on a
time limit, while perfectly appropriate for a video
game, is unacceptable when attempting to have a game
that is largely an exercise in collaborative story-
telling. It's simply too disruptive, and often creates
situations that are damaging to immersion and the
creative process.
