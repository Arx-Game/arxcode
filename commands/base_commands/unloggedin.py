You are not yet logged into the game. Commands available at this point:

To login to the system, you need to do one of the following:

{w1){n If you have no previous account, you must log in as a guest.

     {wguest{n

     Guests automatically are placed in a guest channel where you can
     ask for help by typing {wguest <message>{n. You can then apply
     to play an existing character on the {w@roster{n, or create a
     new character with the {w@charcreate{n command. If your application
     is approved, an email will be sent to you with your password.

{w2){n If you have an account already, use the 'connect' command:

     {wconnect Anna c67jHL8p{n

     if your password was c67jHL8p. If you just created or applied
     for a character, your password is sent to the email you used
     to apply.

   This should log you in. Run {whelp{n again once you're logged in
   to get more aid. Hope you enjoy your stay!

You can use the {wlook{n command if you want to see the connect screen again.
