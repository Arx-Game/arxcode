    A character's story actions that a GM responds to.

        @action/toggletraitor <action #>
        @action/toggleattend <action #>
        @action/noscene <action #>
        
    Creating /newaction costs Action Points (ap). Requires 'tldr' which is a
    short summary in a few words of the action, a category, stat/skill for
    the dice check (just pick whatever might be plausible, GMs can adjust it
    if they disagree), and /ooc_intent which is the what sort of outcome you
    are hoping for, whether that's reputation adjustments, some advancement
    in a story, the favor of important npcs, magical power, whatever. It's just
    to make sure that GMs know what you have in mind for what you're trying
    to accomplish. Use /submit after all options, when ready for GM review. GMs
    may require more info or ask you to edit with /setaction and /submit again.
    Categories: combat, scouting, support, diplomacy, sabotage, research.
    
    With /invite you ask others to assist your action. They use /setaction or
    /cancel, and require all the same fields except category. A covert action 
    can be added with /setsecret. Optional /traitor (and /toggletraitor) switch
    makes your dice roll detract from goal. With /setcrisis this becomes your 
    response to a Crisis. Allocate resources with /add by specifying a type
    (ap, army, social, silver, etc.) and amount, or the ID# of your army. The 
    /makepublic switch allows everyone to see your action after a GM publishes 
    an outcome. If you prefer offscreen resolution, use /noscene toggle. To
    ask questions for GMs, use /question.
    
    Using /toggleattend switches whether your character is physically present,
    or arranging for the action's occurance in other ways. One action may be 
    attended per crisis update; all others must be passive to represent 
    simultaneous response by everyone involved. Up to 5 attendees are allowed
    per crisis response action, unless it is /noscene.

    Actions are private by default, but there's a small xp reward for marking
    a completed action as public with the /makepublic switch.

        @gm/invite <action #>=<player to add as assistant>[,player2,...]

    Commands for GMing. @actions can be claimed/assigned to GMs with the /assign
    switch, and then viewed with @gm/mine. Actions are initially in a draft state
    when players are still in the process of creating them, then are put in the
    /needgm status when they want a GM response. Players have to mark themselves
    as physically attending an action if they're there in person, and they're
    only allowed to be physically present for one crisis action per update.

    If you think players need to change something, or want to answer a question,
    use the /ooc switch. /allowedit will mark them in a state where the player
    can change their action/assist, and then they can submit changes again when
    done. /check allows you to do a roll for an individual, which saves their
    most recent roll result, while /checkall will roll every character in the
    action and total their rolls as the outcome value.

    The result of the action is the /story and optional /secretstory. A
    response may only be written for the main action - players who want an
    individual response should create their own action.

    When done, actions can either be marked as waiting publish for a later date
    with /markpending, or published immediately with /publish. /gemit
    will publish the actions, make a gemit, and post on the story board. To
    make a crisis update, use @gmcrisis/update - this will make a new gemit and
    associate all published/pending publish action with the update, allowing
    players to then create a new crisis action if the crisis is not resolved and
    a new date is set.
