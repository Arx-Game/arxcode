Guest (OOC) commands. These are stored on the Player object
and self.caller is thus always a Player, not an Object/Character.

These commands will be used to implement a character creation
setup based on look and entered prompts.

To-Do list - have character creator prompt for email address at the
start of character creation to save the character-in progress. Iteratively
create the character on the roster, filling in incomplete fields by the player
jumping around to them.

Welcome to {cArx{n, a text based fantasy roleplaying game, similar in design
to many other MUSH based games. Arx is a game of intrigue and adventure,
politics and deeply woven stories, allowing players to enter the ongoing
stories with either a character from a roster of pre-generated characters
that have been a part of the story so far, or to create your own with help
and guidance to best fit into the stories we are creating here.

If you'd like to read about the current stories, or background lore and
completed roleplay, please access our help files with '{whelp{n' to browse
the different subjects. To see a list of commands available to you, use the
'{whelp{n' command. To look at the roster of available characters, use
'{w@roster{n' and '{w@sheet{n'.

To submit an application for a character on the roster that you would like
to play, you will need to supply an email address with {w@add/email <email>{n.
Then enter '{w@roster/apply{n {c<character name>{n {w={n {c<application>{n'.
Your application should contain the reason you'd like to play the character
and what you perceive as their goals and motivations and what direction you
will take their roleplay. Tell us your take on the character. How would you RP
them in a way that contributes to a positive environment and creates
collaborative, fun RP for other people?

To create a new, original character, or to resume a previous session you
were disconnected from, use '{w@charcreate {c<email>{n'. To view a board
of wanted character concepts, use '{w@bb wanted concepts{n'.

The guest channel exists to help new players with
the process of requesting or generating their characters - to speak in it,
please type '{wguest {c<message>{n'.
       """
STAGE1 = \
       """
To start with, choose a unique name for your character that consists of a
single word of only letters - no spaces, numbers, or special characters.

Although characters will typically have both family names, and some may have
titles, every character has a unique first name as an identifier for game
commands. For example, Prince Donrai Thrax would be known by his full name,
but commands such as 'look' would be executed by 'look donrai'.

To choose a name, please use {w'@add/name {c<name>'{n. Names may only consist
of letters, and should generally be between 4-12 characters in length.
       """
STAGE2 = \
       """
A vocation describes your character's occupation. A number of sample
vocations have been prepared, but you are not limited to them. You may
choose either one of the sample vocations, or create your own with
{w'@add/newvocation {c<name>'{n. To select any of the given vocations, use
{w'@add/vocation {c<name>'{n

To get more information about the listed vocations, type {w'help {c<name>'{n for
any. Each sample vocation has a pre-generated list of stats and skills,
which can be modified in a following step. Creating a new vocation will
require you to set them manually.
       """
STAGE3 = \
       """
In this step, you'll create all the details of your character's starting
story. This will let you define who they are now, what their previous
history was, and the overall character concept by defining fields on your
character {w+sheet{n. If any of the fields at all confuse you, please use
the '{whelp{n' command for greater detail.

In order to give detail about your character, you use the '{w@add{n' command
to define a field. For example, the concept field. Your character concept is
an extremely brief two or three word character concept, the most basic
pitch possible for your character. So someone wishing to play a knight
struggling with cynicism and his own past might use the '{w@add{n' command to
'{w@add/concept{n Embittered Knight'. Then they can use the '{w@add{n'
command to define why that concept is accurate for him and just what makes
the character tick by completing the other fields below.

Characters who start at a lower social rank will receive bonus xp after
character creation which they can use in any manner they choose.

To add a field '{w@add/{c<field> <value>{n' For example, '{w@add/age{n 21'
would set the character's age to 21.

If you would prefer to fill in character stats first, you may temporarily
skip this stage with '{w@add/skip{n', though the mandatory fields must be
filled in with the appropriate '{w@add{n' commands before you are able to
submit your character.
       """
STAGE4 = \
       """
You may now adjust the starting skills and stats of your character if you
wish, or submit your character for approval if you're satisfied with how
everything looks. To add or remove skills or stats, use '{wadd/stat{n' or
'{wadd/skill{n', in a format like: '{wadd/stat strength=+1{n'.
{wadd/stat luck=+1{n, {wadd/stat mana=-1{n, {wadd/skill dexterity=+1{n, etc.

To see a list of skills, enter '{whelp skills{n', with a help file of each
under '{whelp {c<skill name>{n'. Stats cost 1 point regardless of their
current rank, while skills cost 1 point per rank for non-combat skills, and
2 points per rank for combat skills. So to raise melee from 4 to 5 would
cost 10 skill points.

If you have selected one of the pre-defined vocations for a character
rather than creating a new one, all stats/skills will already be assigned,
though you may move points around as you wish. Characters of lower social
rank will still receive a bonus to XP after character creation regardless
of their chosen vocation, however.

When you are finished, use {g'add/submit {w<application>'{n to submit your
finished character. Before submission, you can still add or change fields
such as your desc, haircolor, eyecolor, etc. In place of <application>,
please tell us why you'd like to claim this character. For example:
'{w@add/submit She's awesome, and I'm awesome, so this is the
character I think I should play.{n

Thank you for submitting your character. If you provided an email, then
you should receive an email response after GMs review your application.
If you didn't submit an email, GMs will send you a page/tell after they've
finished reviewing your application, providing you with the character's
password if you are approved. To log in to an approved character,
reconnect to ArxMUSH and enter '{wconnect {c<name> <password>{n' with the
